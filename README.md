# My Dotfiles

This repository serves to help me setup/backup and maintain my settings.
It includes not only dotfiles, but also settings and keybindings that stored as files, and instructions to setup for non-file configurations.

## Installation

As it is my on dev state. I don't have script to auto configure it in new computer.
I think in a future it will be included as bash script.
For now you have to do it manually.

1. Install necessary plugins
1. Remove old files
1. Create symlinks
